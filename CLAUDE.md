It enables natural language automation of email, calendar, file management, and contact operations across multiple Microsoft accounts.

**Primary Goal**: Create a robust, secure bridge between AI systems and Microsoft's ecosystem, enabling intelligent productivity automation through conversational interfaces.

## Development Workflow Memory

- Development work is handled by Claude 4 Opus & Sonnet, collectively they cost $200/month and can work 24/7 without breaks. Human involvement is only needed for strategic decisions and oversight
- Archive old or deprecated files in the .old-files/ directory. IMPORTANT you do not have the ability to remove or delete files. The user/stakeholder is the only one in charge of deleting files.
