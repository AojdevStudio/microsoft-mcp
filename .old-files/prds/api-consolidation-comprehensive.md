# [ARCHITECTURE] Microsoft MCP Server API Consolidation

## Metadata
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Backlog
- **Assignee:** AI Agent
- **Estimate:** 40 Story Points / 80 Hours
- **Issue ID:** MSFT-API-CONSOLIDATION
- **Labels:** 
  - type:architecture
  - priority:high
  - agent-ready
  - api-design
  - breaking-change

## Problem Statement

### What
Consolidate the Microsoft MCP server's 61 tools into 46 streamlined tools, reducing API surface complexity by 25% while maintaining functionality and improving developer experience.

### Why
**Current State Issues:**
- **API Bloat:** 61 tools with significant functional overlap and inconsistent patterns
- **Maintenance Burden:** Duplicated code across similar tools increases bug surface and maintenance complexity
- **Developer Confusion:** Multiple tools for similar operations create cognitive overhead and integration friction
- **Business Logic Pollution:** Email templates contain healthcare-specific business logic that doesn't belong in the API layer

**Quantified Impact:**
- 15 redundant tools identified across search, file operations, and email functionality
- 4 business logic tools (email templates) that violate API design principles
- 25% reduction in total tool count improves API discoverability and reduces documentation burden
- Simplified parameter patterns reduce integration complexity by estimated 40%

### Context
Deep analysis of the current tool architecture revealed systematic patterns of over-segmentation:
- **Search Fragmentation:** 5 separate search tools instead of unified search with filtering
- **File Operations:** 3 distinct listing tools that could be unified with parameters
- **Email Templates:** Business-specific logic embedded in infrastructure layer
- **Attachment Handling:** Separate upload/download operations for same conceptual function
- **Parameter Inconsistency:** Similar tools use different parameter names and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1:** Tool count reduced from 61 to 46 tools (25% reduction) with full functional equivalence
- [ ] **AC2:** All business logic (email templates) removed from API layer with client-side migration path provided
- [ ] **AC3:** Unified search tool handles all search scenarios with consistent response format and performance ≤ current best
- [ ] **AC4:** Enhanced file listing tool replaces 3 existing tools with parameter-driven filtering
- [ ] **AC5:** Consolidated attachment tool handles both upload and download operations with action parameter
- [ ] **AC6:** Backward compatibility maintained during 90-day deprecation period with clear migration warnings
- [ ] **AC7:** API response consistency improved with unified error handling and parameter patterns
- [ ] **AC8:** Performance benchmarks show no regression (≤5% response time increase acceptable)
- [ ] **AC9:** Developer documentation updated with migration guide and new tool examples
- [ ] **AC10:** Integration tests validate all consolidation scenarios with edge case coverage

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Notes

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Parameter-Driven Design:** Use parameters instead of separate tools for variations
- **Unified Response Formats:** Consistent structure across similar operations
- **Layer Separation:** Remove business logic from infrastructure layer
- **Graceful Migration:** Deprecation warnings with clear upgrade paths

**Key Technical Constraints:**
- Must maintain Microsoft Graph API call patterns and authentication flows
- Response formats must be backward compatible during transition period
- Error handling must be consistent across consolidated tools
- Performance must not degrade beyond 5% threshold

**Integration Points:**
- `src/microsoft_mcp/tools.py` - Primary consolidation target
- `src/microsoft_mcp/graph.py` - Underlying Graph API client (minimal changes)
- `tests/email_framework/test_mcp_integration.py` - Test updates required
- Documentation and examples across README and tool descriptions

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Framework: pytest, Coverage: 90%, Location: `tests/`
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Framework: pytest-asyncio, Location: `tests/email_framework/`
- [ ] **Performance Tests** - Framework: pytest-benchmark, Location: `tests/performance/`
- [ ] **Migration Tests** - Framework: pytest, Location: `tests/migration/`

### Dependencies
- **Blockers:** None (self-contained refactoring)
- **Related:** Developer checklist for systematic implementation
- **Files to Modify:** 
  - `src/microsoft_mcp/tools.py` (primary)
  - `tests/email_framework/test_mcp_integration.py`
  - `README.md` and tool documentation
  - Migration guide creation

## Detailed Solution Specification

### 1. Search Consolidation (5 → 1 Tool)

**Current Tools to Replace:**
- `search_emails` - Email-specific search
- `search_files` - File-specific search  
- `search_contacts` - Contact-specific search
- `search_sharepoint` - SharePoint-specific search
- `search_unified` - Cross-service search

**New Unified Tool: `search`**
```python
@server.tool()
async def search(
    account_id: str,
    query: str,
    scope: Optional[List[str]] = None,  # ["emails", "files", "contacts", "sharepoint", "all"]
    limit: int = 10,
    sort_by: str = "relevance",  # "relevance", "date", "author"
    filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> SearchResults:
    """
    Unified search across Microsoft 365 services
    
    Args:
        account_id: Microsoft account identifier
        query: Search query string
        scope: Services to search (default: ["all"])
        limit: Maximum results per service (1-100)
        sort_by: Result sorting preference
        filters: Service-specific filters (date ranges, file types, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        SearchResults with categorized results and metadata
    """
```

**Benefits:**
- Single entry point for all search operations
- Consistent parameter naming and response format
- Intelligent result ranking across services
- Simplified client integration

### 2. Business Logic Removal (4 → 0 Tools)

**Tools to Remove:**
- `create_healthcare_email_template`
- `create_dental_appointment_template` 
- `create_patient_reminder_template`
- `create_practice_report_template`

**Migration Strategy:**
- Move template logic to client-side libraries
- Provide template JSON schemas for client implementation
- Create migration guide with code examples
- Templates become data, not API functionality

**Rationale:**
- API should provide infrastructure, not business logic
- Templates are business-specific and don't belong in shared infrastructure
- Client-side implementation allows customization and proper separation of concerns

### 3. File Operations Consolidation (3 → 1 Tool)

**Current Tools to Replace:**
- `list_files` - Basic file listing
- `list_recent_files` - Recent files only
- `list_shared_files` - Shared files only

**New Enhanced Tool: `list_files`**
```python
@server.tool()
async def list_files(
    account_id: str,
    folder_path: Optional[str] = None,
    filter_type: str = "all",  # "all", "recent", "shared", "owned"
    file_types: Optional[List[str]] = None,  # ["docx", "xlsx", "pdf"]
    modified_since: Optional[str] = None,  # ISO 8601 date
    limit: int = 20,
    sort_by: str = "modified",  # "modified", "name", "size", "created"
    sort_order: str = "desc"  # "asc", "desc"
) -> FileListResults:
    """
    Enhanced file listing with flexible filtering
    """
```

### 4. Attachment Operations Consolidation (2 → 1 Tool)

**Current Tools to Replace:**
- `upload_email_attachment`
- `download_email_attachment`

**New Unified Tool: `manage_email_attachment`**
```python
@server.tool()
async def manage_email_attachment(
    account_id: str,
    action: str,  # "upload", "download", "list", "delete"
    message_id: Optional[str] = None,
    attachment_id: Optional[str] = None,
    file_path: Optional[str] = None,
    content: Optional[bytes] = None,
    filename: Optional[str] = None
) -> AttachmentResult:
    """
    Unified attachment management for email messages
    """
```

### 5. Out of Office Optimization (3 → 2 Tools)

**Current Tools:**
- `get_out_of_office_settings`
- `set_out_of_office_message` 
- `clear_out_of_office_message`

**Optimization:**
- Merge `set_out_of_office_message` and `clear_out_of_office_message` into `update_out_of_office`
- Keep `get_out_of_office_settings` separate (different operation pattern)

### 6. Email Context Consolidation (3 → 1 Tool)

**Current Tools to Replace:**
- `get_email_thread_context`
- `get_email_conversation_history`
- `get_related_emails`

**New Unified Tool: `get_email_context`**
```python
@server.tool()
async def get_email_context(
    account_id: str,
    message_id: str,
    context_type: str = "thread",  # "thread", "conversation", "related"
    depth: int = 10,
    include_attachments: bool = False
) -> EmailContextResult:
    """
    Unified email context retrieval with flexible scope
    """
```
