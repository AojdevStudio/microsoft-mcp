# FEATURE KamDental Email Framework

## Metadata
- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assignee:** AI Agent
- **Estimate:** 8 weeks / 32 story points
- **Issue ID:** ENG-001
- **Labels:** 
  - type:feature
  - priority:high
  - agent-ready
  - backend
  - email-framework

## Problem Statement

### What
Transform the Microsoft MCP server into a comprehensive email styling framework that produces consistently professional, branded reports for KamDental practice analytics with sub-30-second generation times.

### Why
Current email generation requires 30+ minutes of manual formatting, lacks brand consistency, and produces inconsistent professional appearance across different practice locations and report types. This inefficiency results in:
- 98% time waste on manual formatting
- Inconsistent brand representation
- Delayed communications to stakeholders
- Poor user experience for operations team

### Context
KamDental operates multiple practice locations (Baytown, Humble) requiring regular analytics reports to executives and operations teams. The existing Microsoft MCP server handles email delivery but lacks professional styling capabilities. A component-based CSS email framework will automate styling while maintaining brand consistency across all communications.

> **ðŸ“‹ Live Preview**: Working prototypes of all components and themes are available in [`docs/visual-mocks.html`](../visual-mocks.html)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** CSS framework loads in <2 seconds with 95%+ email client compatibility
- [ ] **AC2:** Template system automatically selects appropriate theme based on recipient and content type with >95% accuracy
- [ ] **AC3:** All new MCP tools integrate seamlessly while maintaining backward compatibility
- [ ] **AC4:** Framework reduces email creation time from 30+ minutes to <30 seconds (98% improvement)

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utilities.css     # Helper classes
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metrics.css       # Metric cards and grids
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ providers.css     # Provider performance lists
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ alerts.css        # Alert banners
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ recommendations.css # Action item cards
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ baytown.css       # Baytown theme
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ humble.css        # Humble theme
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ executive.css     # Executive theme

```

#### 2. Template System
**Template Classes:**
```python
class EmailTemplate:
    def __init__(self, theme: str = "baytown")
    def render(self, data: dict) -> str

class PracticeReportTemplate(EmailTemplate):
    def render(self, metrics: dict, providers: list, alerts: list) -> str

class ExecutiveSummaryTemplate(EmailTemplate):
    def render(self, locations: list, key_insights: list) -> str
```

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "email_type": "practice-report",
  "theme": "baytown", 
  "summary": "Performance summary text",
  "metrics": [{"label": "MTD Production", "value": "$143,343", "status": "behind"}],
  "alerts": [{"type": "critical", "icon": "ðŸš¨", "message": "Alert message"}],
  "recommendations": [{"priority": "IMMEDIATE", "title": "Action item"}],
  "providers": [{"name": "Dr. Name", "role": "Role", "production": "$Amount"}]
}
```

#### 3. MCP Tool Integration
**New Tools:**
```python
@mcp.tool
def send_practice_report(
    account_id: str, to: str, subject: str,
    financial_data: dict, theme: str = "auto"
) -> dict[str, str]

@mcp.tool  
def send_executive_summary(
    account_id: str, to: str,
    locations_data: list[dict], period: str = "MTD"
) -> dict[str, str]

@mcp.tool
def send_provider_update(
    account_id: str, to: str,
    provider_name: str, performance_data: dict
) -> dict[str, str]

@mcp.tool
def send_alert_notification(
    account_id: str, to: str,
    alert_type: str, message: str, urgency: str = "normal"
) -> dict[str, str]
```
