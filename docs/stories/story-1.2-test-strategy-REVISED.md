# Story 1.2: Test Strategy (REVISED - Technical Debt Aware)

## The Testing Paradox

**Problem:** We're consolidating 61 tools → 15 tools, but keeping 163+ tests for tools we're deprecating. This creates massive technical debt.

**Solution:** Immediate test migration strategy, not parallel testing forever.

## Three-Phase Test Migration

### Phase 1: TODAY (Story 1.2 Implementation)
**Keep tests temporarily for safety**
```python
# tests/test_microsoft_operations.py
class TestMicrosoftOperations:
    """New unified tool tests"""
    # 20-30 focused tests covering all actions
    
# tests/legacy/ (move existing tests here)
# Keep running but mark for deletion
```

### Phase 2: Migration Layer (Story 1.7)
**Transform tests, don't duplicate**
```python
# tests/test_migration.py
@pytest.mark.migration
class TestMigration:
    """Temporary tests proving equivalence"""
    
    def test_all_email_tools_via_unified(self):
        """Single test replacing 25+ email tool tests"""
        # Run all email operations through unified tool
        # This replaces individual tool tests
```

### Phase 3: Final Cleanup (Story 1.8)
**Delete legacy tests with legacy tools**
```bash
# When removing 46 legacy tools, also remove:
rm -rf tests/legacy/
rm tests/test_migration.py

# Final state: ~30 tests for 15 tools (not 300+)
```

## Immediate Test Consolidation Strategy

### Instead of 163+ Legacy Tests, Create 30 Unified Tests

**Old Way (163+ tests):**
```python
def test_list_emails(): ...
def test_list_my_issues(): ...
def test_list_mail_folders(): ...
def test_search_emails(): ...
def test_search_people(): ...
# 25+ individual email tool tests
```

**New Way (5 tests):**
```python
class TestEmailActions:
    """All email operations via unified tool"""
    
    def test_email_listing_operations(self):
        """Replaces all list variant tests"""
        test_cases = [
            {"action": "email.list", "filters": {}},
            {"action": "email.list", "filters": {"folder": "sent"}},
            {"action": "email.list", "filters": {"unread": True}},
        ]
        for case in test_cases:
            assert microsoft_operations(**case)
    
    def test_email_send_operations(self):
        """Replaces send, reply, forward tests"""
        
    def test_email_search_operations(self):
        """Replaces all search variant tests"""
```

## Test Debt Reduction Plan

### Current State (Technical Debt)
- 163+ tests for 61 tools = **2.7 tests per tool**
- Quarantined 21+ tests for non-existent features
- Total: ~184 tests

### Target State (Clean Architecture)
- 30 tests for 15 tools = **2 tests per tool**
- No quarantined tests
- No legacy test burden

### How We Get There

**Story 1.2 (TODAY):**
1. Create `tests/test_microsoft_operations.py` with 10 comprehensive tests
2. Move existing tests to `tests/legacy/` subdirectory
3. Add pytest marker `@pytest.mark.legacy` to all old tests
4. CI runs both sets temporarily

**Story 1.7 (Migration):**
1. Create migration tests that prove equivalence
2. Mark legacy tests with `@pytest.mark.deprecated`
3. Stop running legacy tests in CI

**Story 1.8 (Cleanup):**
1. Delete `tests/legacy/` directory entirely
2. Delete migration tests
3. Final test count: ~30 tests total

## Test Organization for 15 Tools

```python
# tests/test_operations.py (10 tests)
- test_email_operations (replaces 25+ email tests)
- test_calendar_operations (replaces 8 calendar tests)
- test_file_operations (replaces 12 file tests)
- test_contact_operations (replaces 6 contact tests)

# tests/test_utilities.py (8 tests)
- test_authentication (replaces 3 auth tests)
- test_search_unified (replaces 5 search tests)
- test_data_operations (replaces multiple utility tests)
- test_settings_management

# tests/test_email_styling.py (6 tests)
- test_html_utilities
- test_template_application
- test_css_inlining
- test_theme_selection
- test_signature_integration
- test_client_compatibility

# tests/test_integration.py (6 tests)
- test_multi_account_flow
- test_error_handling
- test_performance_benchmarks
- test_pagination
- test_parameter_validation
- test_backward_compatibility
```

**Total: 30 focused, comprehensive tests**

## The Key Insight

**We're not adding a new system alongside the old one.**
**We're REPLACING the old system.**

Therefore:
- Tests should be MIGRATED, not duplicated
- Legacy tests should be DELETED, not maintained
- Technical debt should DECREASE, not increase

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ No regression during transition (temporary legacy tests)
2. ✅ New tests cover all functionality comprehensively
3. ✅ Test count DECREASES from 184 to ~30
4. ✅ Test maintenance burden reduced by 85%
5. ✅ Clear deprecation and deletion timeline

## Timeline

- **Hour 1-2 (Story 1.2):** Create unified tests, move legacy to subfolder
- **Hour 5-6 (Story 1.7):** Add migration tests, stop running legacy
- **Hour 7-8 (Story 1.8):** Delete all legacy tests and migration tests
- **Result:** Clean, maintainable test suite by end of day
