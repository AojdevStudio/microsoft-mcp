Release 0.2.1 — 2025-09-15

Highlights
- Fixed: Account selection hang when `account_id` did not match an authenticated account.
- Docs: Clarified required permissions and multi‑account usage.

Details
- Accept `home_account_id`, email username (case‑insensitive), or `'default'` in `get_token(account_id)`.
- If accounts exist but the supplied `account_id` is invalid, return a clear error listing available accounts instead of entering MSAL device flow.
- Only initiate device flow when there are no cached accounts.
- Document `Mail.Send` as required to avoid 403 on `/me/sendMail`.

Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes.
- You may now pass your email address as `account_id` in all tools, or `'default'` to use the first account.

Verification Steps
1) `list` accounts via the auth tool and pick either an email or `home_account_id`.
2) Call any tool with that value as `account_id`.
3) Try an invalid `account_id` and confirm you get a readable error listing available accounts.
