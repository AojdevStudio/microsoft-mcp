- List of all files requiring fixes
- Priority order for remediation

## Phase 2: PLAN & DESIGN (1 hour)

### Agent: Security Architect
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Goal**: Design secure implementation patterns

**Tasks**:
1. Design HTML escaping implementation strategy
2. Plan Content Security Policy headers
3. Create input validation architecture
4. Design security test framework
5. Plan performance optimization to minimize overhead

**Deliverables**:
- Security implementation blueprint
- Test strategy document
- Performance impact assessment

## Phase 3: WRITE TESTS - TDD (2 hours)

### Agent 1: Security Test Engineer

**Goal**: Create comprehensive XSS prevention tests

**Tasks**:
1. Create tests/security/test_xss_prevention.py
2. Write tests for all XSS payload types
3. Test HTML entity escaping
4. Test template rendering security
5. Create integration tests for secure email sending

### Agent 2: Test Remediation Engineer  
**Priority**: HIGH
**Goal**: Fix failing existing tests

**Tasks**:
1. Fix Gmail compatibility test assertions
2. Fix performance test mocking patterns
3. Update template test assertions
4. Fix CSS inliner edge case tests
5. Ensure all 72 tests will pass

## Phase 4: CODE - Implementation (4 hours)

### Agent 1: Security Implementation Engineer
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Goal**: Fix all XSS vulnerabilities

**Tasks**:
1. Install markupsafe dependency
2. Fix XSS in base.py:74 with HTML escaping
3. Fix XSS in practice_report.py:74-75
4. Implement escaping in all template files
5. Add Content Security Policy headers

### Agent 2: Code Quality Engineer
**Priority**: HIGH
**Goal**: Fix code quality issues

**Tasks**:
1. Remove all 11 unused imports
2. Replace regex CSS parsing with premailer
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement input validation layer
5. Fix all linting issues

## Phase 5: REFACTOR & OPTIMIZE (3 hours)

### Agent: Architecture Optimizer
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Goal**: Simplify over-engineered components

**Tasks**:
1. Analyze template abstraction layers
2. Identify simplification opportunities
3. Refactor while maintaining functionality
4. Optimize performance with security overhead
5. Improve code maintainability

## Phase 6: VALIDATE (3 hours)

### Agent 1: Security Validator
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Goal**: Ensure all security fixes are effective

**Tasks**:
1. Run all XSS payloads against fixed code
2. Perform penetration testing
3. Validate Content Security Policy
4. Check all user inputs are escaped
5. Run security scanning tools

### Agent 2: Integration Tester
**Priority**: HIGH
**Goal**: Ensure system functionality preserved

**Tasks**:
1. Test email rendering in all clients
2. Performance benchmark testing
3. Run full test suite (must be 72/72)
4. Validate cross-browser compatibility
5. Test error recovery scenarios

## Phase 7: WRITE-UP & DOCUMENTATION (2 hours)

### Agent: Documentation Engineer
**Priority**: HIGH
**Goal**: Create comprehensive PR and documentation

**Tasks**:
1. Write detailed PR description
2. Document all security fixes made
3. Create security patterns guide
4. Update API documentation
5. Write deployment and rollback procedures

## ðŸ”„ Parallel Execution Strategy

### Critical Path (Must Complete First):
1. **Security Audit** â†’ **Security Tests** â†’ **Security Implementation** â†’ **Security Validation**

### Parallel Tracks:
- **Track 1**: Security fixes (CRITICAL)
- **Track 2**: Test remediation (HIGH)
- **Track 3**: Code quality (MEDIUM)

### Dependencies:
- Security tests must be written before implementation
- All code changes require test validation
- Documentation requires all implementation complete

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

1. **Security**: 0 XSS vulnerabilities (from 1 critical)
2. **Tests**: 100% pass rate - 72/72 (from 60/72)
3. **Quality**: 0 linting issues (from 11)
4. **Performance**: <5% overhead from security measures

## âš¡ Execution Commands

Each agent will execute their tasks in parallel where possible, following the critical path for security fixes. The orchestration will ensure:

1. Security fixes are implemented immediately
2. Tests are written before code (TDD)
3. All changes are validated
4. Documentation is comprehensive

## ðŸš€ Launch Sequence

1. Start Security Auditor (Phase 1)
2. Based on audit, launch Security Architect (Phase 2)
3. Parallel launch:
   - Security Test Engineer (Phase 3)
   - Test Remediation Engineer (Phase 3)
4. After tests written, parallel launch:
   - Security Implementation Engineer (Phase 4)
   - Code Quality Engineer (Phase 4)
5. Architecture Optimizer (Phase 5)
6. Parallel validation:
   - Security Validator (Phase 6)
   - Integration Tester (Phase 6)
7. Documentation Engineer (Phase 7)

This orchestration ensures the critical security vulnerability is addressed immediately while maintaining code quality and test coverage throughout the process.
