# [SECURITY] Email Framework Security & Quality Remediation

## Metadata
- **Priority:** Urgent
- **Status:** Todo
- **Assignee:** AI Agent
- **Estimate:** 16 hours
- **Issue ID:** SEC-001
- **Labels:** 
  - type:security
  - priority:urgent
  - agent-ready
  - email-framework
  - security-vulnerability

## Problem Statement

### What
Critical security vulnerability (XSS) and quality issues in the email framework template system that prevent PR approval and pose significant security risks to production systems.

### Why
**Security Risk:** HIGH - XSS vulnerability allows script injection through user-provided data, potentially compromising user data and email integrity. **Technical Debt:** MEDIUM - Over-engineered architecture and test failures create maintenance burden and deployment risks.

### Context
PR review identified 12/72 test failures, XSS vulnerability in HTML template rendering, over-engineered architecture, and multiple code quality issues. Current implementation directly inserts user data into HTML without sanitization, creating immediate security exposure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1:** All XSS vulnerabilities eliminated - HTML escaping implemented for all user inputs in template rendering
- [ ] **AC2:** Test suite achieving 100% pass rate (0/72 failures) with comprehensive security test coverage
- [ ] **AC3:** All code quality issues resolved - zero unused imports, proper error handling, lint-clean codebase
- [ ] **AC4:** Security validation implemented - XSS prevention tests and input sanitization verification
- [ ] **AC5:** Architecture simplified where over-engineering identified, maintaining functionality while reducing complexity

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Notes
- **Security Pattern:** Use `markupsafe.escape()` or `html.escape()` for all user-provided data before HTML rendering
- **Template Security:** Implement Content Security Policy headers and validate all dynamic content insertion
- **Architecture Review:** Evaluate template abstraction layers - consider Jinja2 migration for established security patterns
- **CSS Parsing:** Replace regex-based CSS parsing with proper parser library (premailer) for robustness
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling in CSS inliner and template rendering

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests** - Framework: pytest, Coverage: 100%, Location: `/tests/email_framework/`
- [ ] **Security Tests** - Framework: pytest, Location: `/tests/security/test_xss_prevention.py`
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Framework: pytest, Location: `/tests/integration/test_email_templates.py`

### Dependencies
- **Blockers:** None - critical security fix takes precedence
- **Related:** Email framework architecture review, template engine evaluation
- **Files to Modify:** 
  - `src/microsoft_mcp/email_framework/templates/base.py`
  - `src/microsoft_mcp/email_framework/templates/practice_report.py`
  - `src/microsoft_mcp/email_framework/css_inliner.py`
  - `tests/email_framework/` (all test files)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met with security validation
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved with security focus
- [ ] Tests written and passing (100% pass rate required)
- [ ] Security documentation updated with XSS prevention patterns
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment with security verification
- [ ] Penetration testing completed for XSS prevention

## Agent Context

### Reference Materials
- [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [Python markupsafe documentation](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Email HTML security best practices](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/guides/coding/)
- Microsoft Graph API email security guidelines

### Integration Points
- Email template rendering system in `src/microsoft_mcp/email_framework/`
- CSS inlining system for email compatibility
- User input validation layer in `validators.py`
- Microsoft Graph API send_email functionality
- Theme system for location-based email styling

## Validation Steps

### Automated Verification
- [ ] Build pipeline passes with zero security warnings
- [ ] All tests green (72/72 passing)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (ruff, pyright clean)
- [ ] Security scans clean (bandit, safety checks)

### Manual Verification
1. **XSS Prevention Test:** Inject `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in all user input fields - verify proper escaping
2. **Template Rendering Test:** Create email with special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) - verify safe rendering
3. **CSS Inliner Test:** Test complex CSS selectors and edge cases - verify no parsing failures
4. **Performance Test:** Generate 100 emails with large datasets - verify acceptable response times
5. **Cross-Client Test:** Verify rendered emails display correctly in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail

## Agent Execution Record

### Branch Strategy
- **Name Format:** security/SEC-001-email-framework-xss-fixes
- **Security Branch:** Follows security hotfix naming convention

### PR Strategy
**Security PR Requirements:**
- Link to this issue using: "Fixes SEC-001"
- Include security testing evidence
- Require security team review approval
- Include before/after security scan results

### Implementation Approach
**Phase 1: Critical Security Fix (4 hours)**
1. Implement HTML escaping using markupsafe for all user inputs
2. Add Content Security Policy headers to email templates
3. Create comprehensive XSS prevention test suite

**Phase 2: Test Suite Remediation (6 hours)**
1. Fix all 12 failing tests with proper mocking patterns
2. Update assertion patterns for HTML structure validation
3. Add security-specific test cases for XSS prevention

**Phase 3: Code Quality & Architecture (6 hours)**
1. Remove all unused imports and fix linting issues
2. Implement proper CSS parsing with premailer library
3. Evaluate and simplify over-engineered architecture layers
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### Security Validation Protocol
- **Input Sanitization:** Verify all user inputs properly escaped
- **Output Encoding:** Confirm HTML context-appropriate encoding
- **CSP Headers:** Validate Content Security Policy implementation
- **Template Security:** Ensure no unsafe template rendering patterns

### Performance Impact Assessment
- **Before:** Template rendering with security vulnerabilities
- **After:** Secure template rendering with <5% performance overhead
- **Monitoring:** Track template rendering times and memory usage

### PR Integration
- **Security Magic Words:** Fixes SEC-001
- **Auto Close Trigger:** PR merge to main branch after security review
- **Status Automation:** Issue moves to 'Security Verified' then 'Done'
