## Introduction to Elicitation Prompting {#introduction}

**Elicitation prompting** represents a structured approach to AI interaction that bridges the gap between natural language flexibility and deterministic command execution. Unlike traditional conversational prompting, elicitation techniques focus on creating **predictable, repeatable interactions** through well-defined trigger phrases and structured response patterns.

### Why Elicitation Prompting Matters

- **Deterministic Behavior**: Reduces variability in AI responses for consistent user experiences
- **Automation-Friendly**: Enables programmatic interaction with AI systems
- **User Efficiency**: Provides shortcuts for common tasks without verbose natural language
- **System Integration**: Facilitates AI integration into existing workflows and business processes
- **Quality Control**: Standardizes outputs for specific use cases

### Evolution from Natural Language

Traditional AI interaction relies heavily on natural language, which while powerful, can be:
- **Non-deterministic**: Same request may yield different responses
- **Verbose**: Requires detailed explanations for consistent results
- **Context-dependent**: Performance varies based on conversation history
- **Difficult to automate**: Hard to integrate into systematic workflows

Elicitation prompting addresses these limitations while maintaining AI flexibility.

## Core Concepts & Terminology {#core-concepts}

### Elicitation Commands

**Definition**: Structured trigger phrases that invoke specific AI behaviors with predefined parameters and expected outputs.

**Components**:
- **Trigger**: The exact phrase or pattern that activates the command
- **Parameters**: Optional variables that modify command behavior
- **Context**: Background information that shapes response generation
- **Output Format**: Defined structure for the AI's response
- **Priority**: Urgency or importance level affecting response characteristics

### Command Types

#### 1. Action Commands
Trigger specific operations or workflows:
```
run daily
execute backup
generate report
```

#### 2. Query Commands
Request specific information with structured responses:
```
status check
list users
show metrics
```

#### 3. Configuration Commands
Modify system behavior or settings:
```
set priority high
enable debug mode
configure alerts
```

#### 4. Help Commands
Provide documentation or guidance:
```
*help
show commands
explain [feature]
```

### Trigger Patterns

#### Simple Triggers
Single phrases that activate commands:
- `run weekly`
- `check status`
- `urgent report`

#### Parameterized Triggers
Commands that accept variables:
- `run custom [start_date] to [end_date]`
- `analyze [metric] for [period]`
- `compare [entity1] vs [entity2]`

#### Conditional Triggers
Commands with built-in logic:
- `run daily if [condition]`
- `alert when [threshold] exceeded`
- `backup unless [criteria] met`

---

## Elicitation Command Design Patterns {#design-patterns}

### 1. Verb-Object Pattern
**Structure**: `[Action] [Target]`

**Examples**:
- `run report` - Execute report generation
- `check systems` - Verify system status
- `update database` - Modify database records

**Benefits**:
- Intuitive for users familiar with command-line interfaces
- Clear action-target relationship
- Easy to extend with additional parameters

### 2. Hierarchical Pattern
**Structure**: `[Category] [Subcategory] [Action]`

**Examples**:
- `report daily generate`
- `system status check`
- `user permissions update`

**Benefits**:
- Logical organization of complex command sets
- Reduces command name conflicts
- Supports discoverability through categorization

### 3. Natural Language Pattern
**Structure**: Conversational phrases that map to specific actions

**Examples**:
- `analyze this week's performance`
- `what are the current alerts`
- `show me yesterday's results`

**Benefits**:
- Lower learning curve for non-technical users
- Maintains natural AI interaction feel
- Can be combined with structured parameters

### 4. Symbolic Pattern
**Structure**: Special characters or symbols trigger commands

**Examples**:
- `*help` - Display help information
- `@status` - Quick status check
- `#urgent` - Priority escalation

**Benefits**:
- Compact and memorable
- Visually distinct from natural language
- Can indicate special system functions

## YAML-Structured Command Systems {#yaml-systems}

### Why YAML for Command Definition

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) provides several advantages for elicitation command systems:

1. **Human Readable**: Easy to read and modify by both developers and domain experts
2. **Structured**: Enforces consistent command definitions
3. **Extensible**: Simple to add new commands or modify existing ones
4. **Validation**: Can be linted and validated for correctness
5. **Version Control**: Changes can be tracked and managed systematically

### Standard YAML Command Structure

```yaml
command_name:
  trigger: "exact phrase to activate command"
  description: "Human-readable explanation of command purpose"
  action: "Detailed instructions for AI execution"
  parameters:
    - name: "parameter_name"
      type: "string|number|date|boolean"
      required: true|false
      default: "default_value"
      description: "Parameter explanation"
  context:
    domain: "business_area"
    scope: "operational_scope"
    constraints: ["limitation1", "limitation2"]
  output:
    format: "email|report|json|alert"
    template: "template_reference"
    recipients: ["recipient1", "recipient2"]
  execution:
    priority: "low|normal|high|urgent"
    timeout: "duration_in_seconds"
    retry_count: 3
    validation: "validation_rules"
```

### Example: Complete YAML Command Definition

```yaml
financial_analysis:
  daily_report:
    trigger: "run daily"
    description: "Generate daily financial performance summary"
    action: "Analyze today's financial data and create executive summary with key metrics, anomalies, and actionable insights"
    parameters:
      - name: "include_forecasting"
        type: "boolean" 
        required: false
        default: false
        description: "Include predictive analysis for next business day"
    context:
      domain: "finance"
      scope: "daily_operations" 
      constraints: ["business_hours_only", "exclude_pending_transactions"]
    output:
      format: "executive_email"
      template: "daily_financial_summary"
      recipients: ["cfo@company.com", "finance_manager@company.com"]
    execution:
      priority: "high"
      timeout: 180
      retry_count: 2
      validation: "verify_data_completeness"
  
  weekly_trends:
    trigger: "analyze weekly trends"

## Implementation Strategies {#implementation}

### 1. Command Registry Pattern

Create a centralized registry of all available commands:

```yaml
command_registry:
  version: "2.0"
  last_updated: "2025-08-21"
  
  categories:
    operations:
      commands: ["run_daily", "run_weekly", "urgent_report"]
      description: "Operational reporting and monitoring"
    
    analysis:
      commands: ["analyze_trend", "compare_entities", "check_anomalies"]
      description: "Data analysis and insights generation"
    
    administration:
      commands: ["help", "status", "configure"]
      description: "System administration and support"
  
  global_settings:
    default_priority: "normal"
    timeout_limit: 600
    max_retries: 3
    logging_enabled: true
```

### 2. Context-Aware Command Processing

Commands should be processed with awareness of current context:

```yaml
context_processing:
  user_role:
    executive: ["urgent_report", "strategic_analysis", "board_summary"]
    manager: ["daily_report", "team_performance", "operational_metrics"]
    analyst: ["detailed_analysis", "data_validation", "trend_research"]
  
  time_context:
    business_hours: 
      priority_boost: true
      response_time: "immediate"
    after_hours:
      priority_filter: "urgent_only"
      response_time: "next_business_day"
  
  data_availability:
    real_time: ["current_status", "live_metrics", "immediate_alerts"]
    batch_processed: ["daily_reports", "weekly_summaries", "monthly_analysis"]
    historical: ["trend_analysis", "year_over_year", "comparative_studies"]
```

### 3. Error Handling and Fallbacks

Robust elicitation systems include comprehensive error handling:

```yaml
error_handling:
  command_not_found:
    response: "Command not recognized. Type '*help' for available commands."
    suggestions: "fuzzy_match_alternatives"
    logging: "user_command_errors"
  
  insufficient_data:
    response: "Insufficient data for requested analysis."
    fallback: "partial_report_with_limitations"
    escalation: "manual_review_required"
  
  system_timeout:
    response: "Analysis taking longer than expected."
    retry_logic: "exponential_backoff"
    user_notification: "progress_update_email"
  
  invalid_parameters:
    response: "Invalid parameters provided."
    validation: "parameter_format_check"
    correction: "suggest_valid_alternatives"
```

## Advanced Techniques {#advanced-techniques}

### 1. Dynamic Command Generation

Commands can be generated dynamically based on available data or system state:

```yaml
dynamic_commands:
  conditional_availability:
    weekend_reports:
      available_when: "weekend_data_exists"
      trigger: "run weekend"
      action: "Generate weekend operations summary"
    
    emergency_protocols:
      available_when: "crisis_mode_active"
      trigger: "emergency status"
      action: "Activate crisis management reporting"
  
  personalized_commands:
    user_preferences:
      executive_dashboard: "custom_executive_view"
      analyst_tools: "detailed_analytical_suite"
      manager_reports: "operational_management_focus"
```

### 2. Command Chaining and Workflows

Complex operations can be broken into command sequences:

```yaml
command_workflows:
  comprehensive_analysis:
    sequence:
      1: "collect_data"
      2: "validate_quality" 
      3: "perform_analysis"
      4: "generate_insights"
      5: "create_report"
      6: "distribute_results"
    
    failure_handling:
      step_1_fail: "retry_with_alternative_source"
      step_2_fail: "proceed_with_quality_warnings"
      step_3_fail: "fallback_to_basic_analysis"
    
    user_interaction:
      progress_updates: true
      approval_required: ["step_5", "step_6"]
      cancellation_allowed: "any_step"
```

### 3. Multi-Modal Command Processing

Commands can trigger different types of outputs and interactions:

```yaml
multi_modal_commands:
  report_generation:
    outputs:
      email: "formatted_html_email"
      dashboard: "real_time_dashboard_update"
      slack: "summary_notification"
      api: "structured_json_response"
  
  interactive_commands:
    follow_up_questions:
      enabled: true
      max_iterations: 3
      clarification_prompts: "context_specific"
    
    progressive_disclosure:
      initial_summary: "high_level_overview"
      detail_levels: ["summary", "detailed", "comprehensive"]
      user_controlled: "drill_down_on_demand"
```

Elicitation commands should be seamlessly integrated into AI system prompts:

```yaml
system_prompt_integration:
  command_recognition:
    instruction: "When users provide elicitation commands (defined in the elicitation_commands section), execute the specified action with the defined parameters and output format."
    
  command_processing:
    steps:
      1: "Parse trigger phrase and identify matching command"
      2: "Extract any parameters from user input"
      3: "Apply command-specific context and constraints"
      4: "Execute defined action with specified priority"
      5: "Format output according to defined template"
      6: "Include any required metadata or headers"
      
  fallback_behavior:
    unrecognized_command: "Treat as natural language and attempt to fulfill request"
    partial_match: "Suggest closest matching command and ask for clarification"
    ambiguous_input: "Request clarification while offering command alternatives"
```

### Command Documentation Generation

System prompts should include instructions for generating help documentation:

```yaml
help_generation:
  when_triggered: "User types '*help' or similar help command"
  content_structure:
    overview: "Brief system description and capabilities"
    command_categories: "Organized list of command groups"
    command_details: "For each command: trigger, description, examples, parameters"
    usage_examples: "Real-world scenarios and expected outputs"
    troubleshooting: "Common issues and solutions"
  
  format_requirements:
    structure: "Well-organized with clear headings"
    examples: "Include specific usage examples for each command"
    accessibility: "Clear language appropriate for user skill level"
    completeness: "Cover all available functionality"
```
