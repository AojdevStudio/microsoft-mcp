# KamDental Email Framework - Progress Summary

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete (30%)

### Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Explore (10%) ✓
- Analyzed existing email functionality in `tools.py`
- Discovered `ensure_html_structure()` function with basic styling
- Identified integration points with Microsoft Graph API
- Reviewed visual mockups showing component designs and themes
- Understood PRD requirements for professional email styling

#### Phase 2: Plan (20%) ✓
- Designed modular CSS framework architecture
- Planned Python template system with inheritance
- Defined 4 new MCP tools for specialized emails
- Created detailed implementation roadmap
- Identified email client compatibility requirements

#### Phase 3: Write Tests (30%) ✓
- Created comprehensive test suite structure:
  - `test_templates.py`: Template rendering and validation tests
  - `test_css_inliner.py`: CSS inlining and email compatibility tests
  - `test_mcp_integration.py`: MCP tool integration tests
  - `test_email_client_compatibility.py`: Cross-client rendering tests
  - `test_performance.py`: Performance benchmark tests
- All tests follow TDD approach for implementation guidance

### Key Findings

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: The codebase already has:
   - Email sending via Microsoft Graph API
   - Basic HTML formatting with `ensure_html_structure()`
   - Hardcoded signature for Ossie Irondi
   - Support for attachments and multi-recipients

2. **Design Requirements**: From visual mockups:
   - Three themes: Baytown (blue), Humble (purple), Executive (dark)
   - Component library: metrics, providers, alerts, recommendations
   - Professional styling with specific color schemes
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Integration Strategy**:
   - New tools will wrap existing `send_email()` function
   - Templates render to HTML, then passed to existing infrastructure
   - Backward compatibility maintained

### Next Phase: Implementation (Phase 4)

The implementation phase will create:

1. **CSS Framework** (`src/microsoft_mcp/email_framework/`)
   - Core CSS with variables, base styles, utilities
   - Component CSS for metrics, providers, alerts, recommendations
   - Theme CSS for Baytown, Humble, Executive

2. **Template System**
   - `EmailTemplate` base class with Jinja2 integration
   - Specialized templates for each email type
   - Data validation and theme selection logic

3. **Supporting Utilities**
   - CSS inliner for email client compatibility
   - Template renderer with caching
   - Performance optimizations

4. **MCP Tools**
   - `send_practice_report`: Monthly/weekly practice performance
   - `send_executive_summary`: Multi-location overview
   - `send_provider_update`: Individual provider performance
   - `send_alert_notification`: Critical alerts

### Architecture Overview

```
User Request → MCP Tool → Template Selection → Data Validation → 
Template Rendering → CSS Inlining → send_email() → Microsoft Graph API
```

### Test Coverage Ready

All tests are written and ready to guide implementation:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for MCP tools
- Performance benchmarks
- Email client compatibility checks
- Accessibility validation

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Email Client Compatibility**: Tests ensure table-based layouts, inline styles
2. **Performance**: Benchmarks ensure <2s render time, <100KB size
3. **Backward Compatibility**: New tools alongside existing functionality

### Recommendations for Implementation

1. Start with CSS framework foundation
2. Implement base template class
3. Create one complete template (PracticeReport) as proof of concept
4. Add CSS inliner utility
5. Integrate with first MCP tool
6. Iterate through remaining templates and tools

The project is well-positioned for implementation with clear requirements, comprehensive tests, and a solid architectural plan.
