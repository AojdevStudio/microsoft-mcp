      - command: '/init-protocol --force'
        purpose: 'Overwrite an existing CLAUDE.md file without user confirmation.'
      - command: '/init-protocol --level advanced'
        purpose: 'Force the selection of a specific framework maturity level.'

      - 'Check if CLAUDE.md exists; if yes and no --force flag, prompt for confirmation.'
      - 'CRITICAL: First look for and read project documentation (README.md, PLAN.md, PRD.md, IMPLEMENT.md, docs/) to understand what the user is actually building.'
      - "Distinguish between Claude Code framework files (.claude/, ai-docs/) and the actual project - focus on understanding the user's project goals."
      - "If the project appears empty or only contains framework files, ASK THE USER: 'What type of project are you planning to build here?'"
      - 'Analyze actual project structure (not framework): identify languages, patterns, architecture from non-framework files.'
      - 'Determine project complexity using the framework decision matrix based on the ACTUAL PROJECT, not the framework.'
      - 'Select protocol categories that match what the user is TRYING TO BUILD, not just what tools are present.'
      - "Generate protocols customized for the user's actual project goals and context."
      - "Start CLAUDE.md with a clear 'Project Context' section explaining what this project is actually about."
      - "Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with all selected frameworks adapted to the project's true purpose."
      - 'Include a project-specific quick start guide based on the actual project goals.'
      - "Save the final CLAUDE.md and provide a summary focused on how it will help achieve the project's objectives."

    # Criteria to evaluate the success of the generated CLAUDE.md file.
    success_metrics:
      - '✅ CLAUDE.md clearly explains what the project is actually about (not just the framework).'
      - "✅ Protocols match the user's actual project goals and technologies."
      - '✅ Framework complexity aligns with project needs.'
      - '✅ Custom commands are relevant to what the user is building.'
      - '✅ Self-improvement mechanisms capture project learnings.'
      - '✅ Team coordination protocols match the collaboration style.'
      - '✅ Project context section is clear and informative.'

    # Self-improvement mechanism to learn from protocol generation experiences.
    learning_protocol:
      common_mistakes_to_avoid:
        - 'Focusing on framework files instead of actual project content.'
        - 'Generating generic protocols without understanding project purpose.'
        - 'Missing the distinction between tools (framework) and goals (project).'
        - 'Not asking the user about their project when repo appears empty.'
      improvement_actions:
        - 'Always read project documentation first before analyzing code.'
        - 'Distinguish between framework presence and project substance.'
        - 'Include clear project context at the top of every CLAUDE.md.'
        - 'Ask clarifying questions when project purpose is unclear.'
      feedback_integration:
        - 'When users point out missing context, update the init-protocol to capture it.'
        - 'Learn from each generation to improve future protocol creation.'
        - 'Maintain awareness that this is a meta-tool for helping users with their actual projects.'
