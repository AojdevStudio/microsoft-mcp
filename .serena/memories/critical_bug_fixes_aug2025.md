# Critical Bug Fixes & Recent Updates (August 2025)

## Major Bug Fix: Pagination Parameter Mismatch ✅
**Issue**: All Microsoft Graph pagination operations were failing due to parameter name mismatch (`max_items` vs `limit`)

**Affected Operations**:
- Email listing (`list_emails`)
- Contact search (`search_contacts`) 
- File browsing (`list_files`)
- Calendar operations (`list_events`)

**Resolution**: Fixed parameter mapping across all 4 core tools
- Updated `graph.py` to handle `limit` parameter correctly
- Ensured consistent pagination across all Microsoft Graph operations
- All listing operations now functional

## Nuclear Simplification Achievements ✅
- **Tool Reduction**: 61+ tools → 5 focused tools (90% reduction)
- **Token Efficiency**: 63k token monolithic tool → modular architecture
- **Action-Based Routing**: Consistent `account_id` + `action` pattern
- **Infrastructure**: Enhanced error handling and API consistency

## Current Operational Status (as of August 2025)
- ✅ Email operations: list, send, reply, draft, delete
- ✅ Calendar operations: create, update, list, search, delete
- ✅ Contact operations: list, create, update, delete, search
- ✅ File operations: list, upload, download, share, delete
